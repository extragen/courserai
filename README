This is your new Play application
=====================================

1. Install Java 7 Update 45
2. Install Play Framework v.2.2.1
    2.1. Download http://downloads.typesafe.com/play/2.2.1/play-2.2.1.zip
    2.2. Add the play script to your PATH
        For convenience, you should add the framework installation directory to your system PATH. On UNIX systems, this means doing something like:

        export PATH=$PATH:/relativePath/to/play

        On Windows you’ll need to set it in the global environment variables. This means update the PATH in the environment variables and don’t use a path with spaces.
    2.3. Check that the play command is available
        From a shell, launch the play help command.

        $ play help
